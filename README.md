# WebCalculator

Calculator made with HTML, CSS and JS.

This one was really challenging for me, I had to remake the code a lot and test it all the time before committing something.

Things I learned tackling this one:

I. Getting a better grasp at reusing variables

II. Rounding a number to have a max of 2 decimals

III. Adding event-listeners to multiple buttons using built-in JS functions
